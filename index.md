## About Me

To describe who I am, I am person who has a thirst for experience. Experience does not include only my professional career, but what I can learn culturally. I was born into a mixed family where my dad's side of the family is from Guyana while my mom's side is from the Philippines. With my dad being in the military, I spent my childhood years in Hawaii, Japan, Philippines, and California. My experiences living in these places led me to be the curious and open-minded person I am today.
