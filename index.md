## About Me

To describe who I am, I am person who has a thirst for experience. Experience does not include only my professional career, but what I can learn culturally. I was born into a mixed family where my dad's side of the family is from Guyana while my mom's side is from the Philippines. With my dad being in the military, I spent my childhood years in Hawaii, Japan, Philippines, and California. My experiences living in these places led me to be the curious and open-minded person I am today.

The idea of being involved with either aircrafts or spacecrafts was something I always been interested in since I was in high school. With math and science being my favorite subjects during school, I figured that I would pursue aerospace engineering through high school and college. The high school I attended at my hometown was located on a communtiy college campus, so I was allowed to take college classes in conjuction with high school classes.

After getting my Aerospace Engineering degree from UC San Diego, I worked as an admistrative engineer at an aerospace manufacturing company for half a year. I helped look through non-conforming parts and assign dispositions and documentations for technicians to follow in order to fix the parts. Here, I was able to get closer to the engineers and got more interested in what it meant to be an engineer.

After that half year, the same company I worked at hired me full time to be a manufacturing engineer. With this being the start of my engineering career, I am very excited and eager to learn more about being an engineering and gaining more experiences. I know that I am at the start of my engineering career but I know I will have a long road ahead of me.
