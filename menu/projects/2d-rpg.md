## Intents and Purposes

I'm currently learning how to use the Godot Game Engine to some day create my own video game. For me to learn, I decided to follow a series of YouTube videos to gain an understanding on how to use the engine.

## The Game

The second game tutorial I am following is for a 2D RPG. The tutorial series is called [Make an Action RPG in Godot 3.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAbG8Oi-SvQ&list=PL9FzW-m48fn2SlrW0KoLT4n5egNdX-W9a). This one I will be able to post updates on my progress as I go along with the tutorial series.
