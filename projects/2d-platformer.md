## Intents and Purposes

I'm currently learning how to use the Godot Game Engine to some day create my own video game. For me to learn, I decided to follow a series of YouTube videos to gain an understanding on how to use the engine.

## The Game

The first game I've learned to make was a 2D Platformer. I spent time following a tutorial series called [Make Your First 2D Gane with Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc13Z2gboEk&list=PLhqJJNjsQ7KH_z21S_XeXD3Ht3WnSqW97) and essentially went along and made my own game.
